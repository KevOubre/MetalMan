Br. Alan Drain wanted to join the Brothers of the Sacred Heart at a very young age. He grew up in Mobile, Alabama, where he attended St. Mary’s Catholic School, a school founded by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart, from 1st through 8th grade. Three other members of Br. Alan’s family were already Brothers. After considering it for a few years, Br. Alan decided to give the Brothers a try. He never looked back. He overcame doubt from his family to become a Brother of the Sacred Heart. As a child, Br. Alan often helped his siblings with their school work. This helped him to find his passion as a teacher, specializing in English and history. Br. Alan has served at St. Aloysius, Cor Jesu, McGill Institute, St. Stanislaus, and Brother Martin. As a teacher, Br. Alan was as tough as they come. He gave students reading assignments every night and expected plenty from them. Br. Alan was sure
to give them his best too, working hard to make sure to get the most out of each student.
